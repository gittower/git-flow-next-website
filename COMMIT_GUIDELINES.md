# Commit Guidelines

## Format

```
<Imperative verb> <concise description>
```

## Rules

1. **Start with a capitalized imperative verb** — e.g. Add, Update, Fix, Remove, Improve, Move, Replace, Bump
2. **Keep it short** — aim for under 70 characters
3. **No trailing period**
4. **No prefixes** — don't use conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`) or ticket numbers
5. **Single line** — no multi-line bodies; the subject line should be self-explanatory
6. **Be specific** — describe *what* changed, not *why*

## Examples

```
Add configuration documentation
Update documentation for v1.0.0 release
Fix broken links
Remove code block background in hero
Improve readability for blog posts
Move cheat sheet to public folder
Replace Hero image with animated video
Bump version to 1.0 and add Changelog entry
```
